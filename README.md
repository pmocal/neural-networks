When entering the Kaggle competition for recognizing digits in the MNIST dataset my neural network achieved a score of 0.95780.

From the Kaggle competition [page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer):
> MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In `neural-network.py` there is a trainvalidate method which shows both validation and training error.
